% Intro to the Task
The task of the third assignment is to create a web version of the Memory game. In this game, different user can play a game and see the highscore of all users who have played before.

% Server side
The applications is composed of two systems, the backend and frontend.
% Backend
The backend is responsible to authenticate the user with a username, save the highscore of each user, and respond the number of points for each guess made by the user. Additionally, it should be possible to set a \textit{development mode}, where the grid of the memory is deterministic. Otherwise, in \textit{production mode}, the grid is generated randomly.

% Frontend
The frontend side consists of the game (User Interface),v where the user can play the actual game. This frontend has to be implemented using JavaScript and it should communicate with the backend using Ajax.
