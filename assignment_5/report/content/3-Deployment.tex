\section{Deployment}\label{sec:03_depl}
% Explain section
This section explains the deployment of the application.
% Requirements
The requirements to run all applications are the following (the versions correspond to the local system of the author):
\begin{itemize}
\item H2 2.0.202
\item WildFly 20.0.1.Final
\item Java 11.0.11 (AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9)
\item Apache Tomcat 9.0.56

\end{itemize}


% Create database
\subsection{H2 Database}\label{sec:03_depl_h2}
% What
As mentioned before, this application uses a local H2 database, that is not integrated in the project itself, but is located somewhere, locally, on the users computer.

% Start H2
\subsubsection{Start H2}\label{sec:03_depl_h2_start}
At first, it is important to start the H2 service via the terminal. This can be accomplished by executing the command \texttt{\$ java -jar h2*.jar} in the directory \path{\$H2/bin}, where \texttt{\$H2} is the path of the H2 database. This process is shown in \Fig{fig:03_depl_h2_h2start}. After executing this comman, the H2 console is automatically started in the default web browser, which is needed later.
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{images/03_depl/h2_start}
\caption{H2 database start process}
\label{fig:03_depl_h2_h2start}
\end{figure}

% Create a Database
\subsubsection{Create a Database}\label{sec:03_depl_h2_create}
After the H2 service has been started, it is possible to create a new local database using the shell tool of H2. This process is shown in \Fig{fig:03_depl_createdb_create}, where the command \texttt{\$ java -cp h2-*.jar org.h2.tools.Shell} needs to get executed in the \path{\$H2/bin} directory. It is important, that the databse is called \textit{accommodations}, and the username is \textit{sa}, and the the password is \textit{sa} as well.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.18]{images/03_depl/create-db}
\caption{H2 database start process}
\label{fig:03_depl_createdb_create}
\end{figure}

% Web browser
\subsubsection{Test Database Connection}\label{sec:03_depl_h2_test}
After creating the \textit{accommodations} database, it is possible to test the connection using the H2 console mentioned in \Sec{sec:03_depl_h2_start}.
% How to test
First, it is necessary to fill in the correct informations: The JDBC URL in the format \texttt{jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/PATH\_TO\_DATABASE/accommodations}, and the previousely used username and password from \Sec{sec:03_depl_h2_create} (username: \texttt{sa}, password: \texttt{sa}).
% Test
Then, by clicking on \textit{Test Connection}, a status message is shown, as illustrated in \Fig{fig:03_depl_createdb_h2test}. If the connection is successful, the database can be used in the application.
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/03_depl/h2_test}
\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_createdb_h2test}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Seeding the Database}\label{sec:03_depl_seeddb}
% What
After the database has been created, it is important to write dummy data to it using the \textit{DatabaseRoutine} application.

\subsubsection{Set up the DatabaseRoutine application}\label{sec:03_depl_seeddb_setup}
% How
It is important to set the path to the database in the \path{persistance.xml} of the \textit{DatabaseRoutine} application. \Lst{lst:03_depl_seeddb_setup_config} shows a correct configuration. The property \texttt{hibernate.connection.url} has to be set to the URL used in \Sec{sec:03_depl_h2_create}.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:03_depl_seeddb_setup_config, caption=Default data source configuration, language=xml]
...
<persistence-unit name="default">
  <properties>
    <property name="hibernate.connection.url"
              value="jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/workspace/145085_web-architectures/assignment_5/accommodations"/>
  </properties>
</persistence-unit>
...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Execute the DatabaseRoutine application}\label{sec:03_depl_seeddb_executeroutine}
% How
To execute the DatabaseRoutine application, open the project in IntelliJ, right-click on the \path{DataRoutine.java} file, and select \textit{Run 'DataRoutine.main()'}. Then, the file gets executed and writes dummy data to the database.

% Check
After that, it is possible to check if the data has been written to the database by connecting to the database using the H2 console, introduced in \Sec{sec:03_depl_h2_create}. \Fig{fig:03_depl_seeddb_executeroutine_data} shows the newly created tables in the database.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/03_depl/dummy-data}
\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_seeddb_executeroutine_data}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Setting up WildFly}\label{sec:03_depl_wildfly}
% Set up Wildfly
After the H2 database is created, the EJB`s can be deployed to the WildFly application server.

% H2
It is important to mention, that at this point the H2 database (explained in \Sec{sec:03_depl_h2}) has to be running.

% Set up the datasource
\subsubsection{Add H2 database datasource}\label{sec:03_depl_wildfly_datasource}
To give the EJB`s the ability to access the database, the \textit{accommodations} database has to be defined as a datasource in the configuration file of WildFly. The configuration file is located at \path{\$JBOSS\_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml}, where \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME} is the path to WildFly. \Lst{lst:03_depl_wildfly_datasource_config} shows how the in \Sec{sec:03_depl_createdb} created H2 database can be added as a datasource in WildFly.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:03_depl_wildfly_datasource_config, caption=Default data source configuration, language=xml]
...
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:6.0">
  <datasources>
    <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/AccommodationsDS" pool-name="AccommodationsDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true" statistics-enabled="${wildfly.datasources.statistics-enabled:${wildfly.statistics-enabled:false}}">
      <connection-url>jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/workspace/145085_web-architectures/assignment_5/accommodations;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
      <driver>h2</driver>
      <security>
        <user-name>sa</user-name>
        <password>sa</password>
      </security>
    </datasource>
    ...
  </datasources>
</subsystem>
...
\end{lstlisting}

% Also to the project
Additionally, this datasource has to be defined in the \path{persistance.xml} configuration file of the WebServices project as well, which is shown in \Lst{lst:03_depl_wildfly_datasource_persistance}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:03_depl_wildfly_datasource_persistance, caption=Default data source configuration, language=xml]
...
<persistence-unit name="default">
  <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/AccommodationsDS</jta-data-source>
  <properties>
    <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>
    <property name="hibernate.format_sql" value="true"/>
    <property name="hibernate.use_sql_comments" value="true"/>
  </properties>
</persistence-unit>
...
%\end{lstlisting}


% Build EJB jar
\subsubsection{Compile EJB Jar}\label{sec:03_depl_wildfly_jar}
Third, the EJB`s need to to be deployed to the Wildfly server. Therefore, it is necessary to run the command \texttt{\$ mvn clean package} in the directory of the \textit{WebServices} project, which builds the \texttt{.jar} artifact containing all EJB`s. After that, a new directory called \path{/target} was created in the root folder of the \textit{WebServices} project, where the EJB JAR \path{marcel-stolin-web-services.jar} is located, which is shown at \Fig{fig:03_depl_wildfly_jar_build}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/03_depl/web-services-artifact}
\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_wildfly_jar_build}
\end{figure}


% Deploy jar
\subsubsection{EJB JAR Deployment}\label{sec:03_depl_wildfly_deploy}
After the \texttt{.jar} artifact has been created, it needs to be copied to the deployment directory of the Wildfly server. The artifact can be deployed using the command shown in \Lst{lst:03_depl_wildfly_deploy_command}, where \texttt{\$JBOSS\_HOME} is the path to the local Wildfly directory. This command needs to be executed in the project folder of the \textit{WebServices} project, which is shown in \Fig{fig:03_depl_wildfly_deploy_command}.
% Command
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:03_depl_wildfly_deploy_command, caption=Default data source configuration, language=sh]
$ cp target/marcel-stolin-web-services.jar $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_wildfly_deploy_command}
\end{figure}


% Start Wildfly server
\subsubsection{Start Wildfly Application Server}\label{sec:03_depl_wildfly_start}
Finally, the Wildfly server can be started using the command \texttt{\$ bin/standalone.sh}. Additionally, the log shows the lookup address of both the \textit{AccommodationService} (mentioned in \Sec{sec:02_impl_beans_acc}) and the \textit{ReservationService} (mentioned in \Sec{sec:02_impl_beans_acc_reservation}), which is illustrated in \Fig{fig:03_depl_wildfly_start_addresses}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{images/03_depl/deployed-beans}
\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_wildfly_start_addresses}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Starting the Web Application}\label{sec:03_depl_webapp}
% Important things
After the database has been created successfully, and the EJB`s have been deployed successfully, the web application can be deployed to Apache Tomcat.

% Different port
One problem is, that \textit{WildFly} already uses port 8080, and \textit{Apache Tomcat} uses port 8080 by default as well. Therefore, \textit{Apache Tomcat} has to be configured to use port 8000 instead.

% Intellij
\subsubsection{IntelliJ Configuration}\label{sec:03_depl_webapp_intellij}
% How
To deploy the web application on using \textit{IntelliJ}, it is necessary to create an new \textit{Run Configuration} for \textit{Apache Tomcat} in the \textit{WebApp} project.

% Server
\paragraph{Server Settings}
The \textit{Server} settings for \textit{IntelliJ} are shown in \Fig{fig:03_depl_webapp_intellij_config1}. It is important, that the URL is set to \url{http://localhost:8000/marcel-stolin-web-app/}, and the HTTP port is set to 8000. In addition, under \textit{Before launch} it is import to build the \textit{WebApp:war exploded} artifact.
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/03_depl/tomcat-config-1}
\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_webapp_intellij_config1}
\end{figure}

% Deployment
\paragraph{Deployment Settings}
\Fig{fig:03_depl_webapp_intellij_config2} shows the settings for the \textit{Deployment} section. It is neccessary to deploy the \textit{WebApp:war exploded} artifact on server startup. Additionally, the \textit{Application Context} need to be set to \texttt{marcel-stolin-web-app}.
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Successfull connection test for the H2 database}
\label{fig:03_depl_webapp_intellij_config2}
\end{figure}

% Start server
\paragraph{Accessing the Application}
After running the \textit{Run Configuration} for \textit{Apache Tomcat} from \textit{IntelliJ}, the web application is available at \url{http://localhost:8000/marcel-stolin-web-app/}.
