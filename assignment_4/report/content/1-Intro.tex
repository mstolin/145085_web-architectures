% Intro
The third assignment is about creating an \textit{Angular} application that presents all members of the Scottish parliament.
% What
It is supposed to consist of two components, a list, and a member detail page.

% List
The list is responsible to list all members of the Scottish parliament. It shows the profile picture of the member and the name. If the profile picture is not available, a dummy image is supposed to be presented.

% Detail page
After the user clicks on a list item, the user will be forwarded to the detail page of the member, where the user can see more details. It shows, the member ID, the profile picture, the name, the birthdate, all current and past party memberships, and all associated websites.

% Data
The professor provides all URLs to fetch the data. It is available in JSON format.


% Deployment
Another requirement is, that the \textit{Angular} application must be delivered as a \texttt{.war} using \textit{Tomcat}.
